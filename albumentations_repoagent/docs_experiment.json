When an attribute with the given name does not exist on the class, __getattr__ is called with the class object (cls) and the attribute name (name) as arguments. Instead of raising an AttributeError, this implementation returns a new instance of MagicMock. This behavior is particularly useful in testing scenarios, where it is desirable to mock out undefined attributes dynamically without explicitly specifying them in advance. Each time an undefined attribute is accessed, a fresh MagicMock object is returned, allowing for flexible and isolated testing of attribute interactions.\n\n**Note**:  \n- This method only triggers for attributes that are not already defined on the class.\n- Every access to an undefined attribute will result in a new MagicMock instance, which may lead to different mock objects for repeated accesses to the same attribute name.\n- This approach is commonly used in testing frameworks to facilitate the mocking of arbitrary attributes.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nIf an attribute foo is accessed on the class and it does not exist, the return value will be a new MagicMock instance, such as:\n<MagicMock id='140123456789456'>"

This alternative uses NumPy slicing to reverse the columns of the image, ensuring compatibility with a broader range of image types and data formats.\n\nBy dynamically selecting the flipping method, this function ensures both optimal performance and broad compatibility within image augmentation workflows.

The function returns a new image array with the HSV channels shifted accordingly, without modifying the original input image.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The input image must be in RGB format before calling this function.\n- The function always applies a shift of 20 to each of the hue, saturation, and value channels.\n- The returned image will have the same shape and data type as the input image, with color values adjusted in the HSV color space.\n- The function does not modify the input image in place.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nGiven an input RGB image of shape (256, 256, 3) and dtype uint8, the function returns a NumPy array of the same shape and dtype, where the hue, saturation, and value have each been shifted by 20 units. For example:\n\narray([[[ 45, 130, 210],\n        [ 60, 150, 200],\n        ...],\n       ...], dtype=uint8)\n\nFor a float32 image with values in [0.0, 1.0], the output will be of the same shape and dtype, with all values clipped to the [0.0, 1.0] range after HSV adjustment."

The posterize operation reduces the number of bits used to represent each color channel, effectively decreasing the color depth and creating a stylized, posterized effect. Internally, this function calls albumentations.posterize with the input image and a fixed bits value of 4.

Posterization is an image effect that reduces the number of bits used to represent each color channel, resulting in fewer distinct colors and a stylized, flat look. In this implementation, the function sets the number of bits to 4, meaning each color channel (red, green, blue) will have 16 possible values instead of the usual 256.

Its primary responsibilities are to ensure that each relevant data field is appropriately filtered, converted from the internal processing format to the required output format, and that label fields are separated from the main data fields for further use.\n\nThe method operates as follows:\n1. It retrieves the spatial dimensions (rows and columns) from the shape of the \"image\" entry in the data dictionary.\n2. For each data field listed in self.data_fields, it performs two operations:\n   - It applies the filter method to the data field, passing in the current rows and columns. The filter method is intended to process or adjust the data field according to the image dimensions.\n   - It then calls check_and_convert on the filtered data field, with direction set to \"from\". This ensures that the data is validated and/or converted from the internal \"albumentations\" format to the target output format, as required by the pipeline configuration.\n3. After processing all data fields, the method calls remove_label_fields_from_data. This function extracts any label fields (such as class IDs) from the data fields (e.g., bounding boxes) and stores them as separate entries in the data dictionary, removing them from the original data fields.\n4. The method returns the fully processed and cleaned data dictionary.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all data fields are correctly formatted, validated, and organized for downstream tasks such as model evaluation or saving to disk.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The filter method must be properly implemented to perform meaningful filtering or adjustment; otherwise, it acts as a placeholder.\n- The check_and_convert method relies on the current format configuration and must have the necessary conversion and validation logic implemented.\n- The remove_label_fields_from_data method assumes that label fields are appended to the end of each data entry in the relevant data fields and that self.params.label_fields and self.data_length are correctly set.\n- The input data dictionary must contain an \"image\" entry with a valid shape attribute.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nGiven input data:\n{\n    \"image\": <numpy array of shape (256, 256, 3)>,\n    \"bboxes\": [\n        [10, 20, 30, 40, 1],\n        [15, 25, 35, 45, 2]\n    ]\n}\nAssuming self.data_fields = [\"bboxes\"], self.data_length = 4, and self.params.label_fields = [\"class_id\"], the output after postprocess would be:\n{\n    \"image\": <processed numpy array of shape (256, 256, 3)>,\n    \"bboxes\": [\n        [10, 20, 30, 40],\n        [15, 25, 35, 45]\n    ],\n    \"class_id\": [1, 2]\n}"

For each transform:\n  - If the transform is an instance of DualTransform, it updates last_dual to the current index. If this is the first DualTransform found, it also records the index as the start of the dual region.\n  - If the transform is an instance of BaseCompose (which represents a nested composition of transforms), the method recursively calls itself to search for DualTransform instances within the nested composition. If any are found, it updates last_dual and, if necessary, sets the start index.\n- After completing the iteration, if any DualTransform (directly or within a nested composition) was found, the method appends the last_dual index to dual_start_end, resulting in a two-element list: [start_index, end_index].\n- If no DualTransform is found, the method returns None.\n\nThis method is called during the initialization of the Transforms class, where it is used to precompute and store the indices of the DualTransform region within the sequence. This information can be used later to optimize processing or to ensure correct handling of dual transforms during augmentation.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The function only returns the indices of the first and last DualTransform (or nested DualTransform) found in the sequence. If there are no DualTransform instances, it returns None.\n- The method handles nested compositions by recursively searching within BaseCompose instances.\n- The returned indices refer to the positions in the original transforms list, not within any nested compositions.\n- This method is intended for internal use and is not part of the public API.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nIf the input transforms list is:\n[SomeTransformA, DualTransformB, SomeTransformC, DualTransformD, SomeTransformE]\n\nThe return value would be:\n[1, 3]\n\nIf there are no DualTransform instances in the list, the return value would be:\nNone\n\nIf there is a nested BaseCompose containing DualTransform instances at positions 2 and 4, the return value would reflect the indices in the outer list where the nested DualTransforms are found. For example:\n[2, 4]"

Any None values in the list are filtered out.\n· bbox_params: Optional. Configuration for bounding box processing, either as a dictionary of parameters or a BboxParams instance. If provided, enables bounding box support in the augmentation pipeline.\n· keypoint_params: Optional. Configuration for keypoint processing, either as a dictionary of parameters or a KeypointParams instance. If provided, enables keypoint support in the augmentation pipeline.\n· additional_targets: Optional. A dictionary mapping additional data field names to their types, allowing the pipeline to process extra targets beyond the standard image, bboxes, and keypoints.\n· p: The probability of applying the composed set of transforms. Default is 1.0 (always apply).\n\n**Code Description**:  \nThis initialization method sets up the Compose object to orchestrate a sequence of image augmentations and manage associated data such as bounding boxes and keypoints. It first calls the superclass initializer with the provided list of transforms, filtering out any None values, and sets the probability p for applying the composed transforms.\n\nThe method then prepares processors for handling bounding boxes and keypoints if their respective parameters are provided:\n\n- For bounding boxes, if bbox_params is given as a dictionary, it is converted into a BboxParams object; if it is already a BboxParams instance, it is used directly. If bbox_params is of any other type, a ValueError is raised. The method then creates a BboxProcessor with these parameters and any additional_targets, and stores it in the processors dictionary under the key \"bboxes\".\n- For keypoints, the process is analogous: keypoint_params can be a dictionary or a KeypointParams instance, and is validated accordingly. A KeypointsProcessor is created and stored under the key \"keypoints\" in the processors dictionary.\n\nIf additional_targets is not provided, it defaults to an empty dictionary. The additional_targets attribute is set to this value, allowing the Compose object to handle extra data fields as specified.\n\nAfter setting up the processors, the method ensures that all transforms in the pipeline are valid for the configured processors by calling ensure_transforms_valid on each processor. This step checks for compatibility between the transforms and the data types (e.g., certain keypoint formats may not be supported by all transforms).\n\nFinally, the method registers the additional_targets with the Compose object using add_targets, ensuring that any extra data fields are properly managed during augmentation.\n\nThe relationship with callees is as follows:\n- BboxParams and KeypointParams are used to encapsulate configuration for bounding boxes and keypoints, respectively.\n- BboxProcessor and KeypointsProcessor are responsible for validating, filtering, and converting bounding box and keypoint data according to the provided parameters.\n- The processors ensure that the transforms applied by Compose are compatible with the data formats and requirements specified by the user.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The transforms list must not contain None values; these are automatically filtered out.\n- bbox_params and keypoint_params must be provided as either dictionaries or their respective parameter class instances; otherwise, initialization will fail with a ValueError.\n- The additional_targets dictionary allows for flexible extension of the augmentation pipeline to handle custom data fields.\n- The method validates that all transforms are compatible with the configured data processors, helping to prevent runtime errors due to format mismatches.\n- Proper configuration of label_fields and data formats in bbox_params and keypoint_params is essential for correct operation of the augmentation pipeline."

Upon invocation, it first initializes a container for saving transformation parameters by inserting a defaultdict(dict) into the kwargs under a specific key (self.save_key). It then delegates the actual transformation process to its superclass by calling the parent __call__ method, passing along the force_apply flag and the updated kwargs. This superclass call executes the transformation pipeline, applying each transformation to the input data and collecting the parameters used for each transformation in the process.\n\nAfter the transformations are applied, the method serializes the transformation pipeline structure, including unique identifiers for each transformation, using get_dict_with_id(). It then calls fill_with_params to recursively inject the actual parameters used for each transformation into the serialized structure, replacing the internal identifiers. Next, it calls fill_applied to annotate each transformation in the serialized pipeline with a boolean flag indicating whether it was actually applied during this run.\n\nFinally, the method updates the result dictionary's save_key entry with the fully populated and annotated serialized pipeline and returns the result. This enables users to inspect, debug, or replay the exact sequence and configuration of transformations that were applied to the input data.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The method modifies the kwargs in place by adding a parameter-saving container.\n- It relies on the superclass implementation to perform the actual data transformation and parameter collection.\n- The serialized pipeline structure returned in the result includes both the parameters used and flags indicating which transformations were applied, making it suitable for reproducibility, debugging, and replay scenarios.\n- The method assumes that each transformation in the pipeline can be uniquely identified and that parameter mappings are correctly maintained.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nA typical return value from this method might look like the following:\n\n{\n    'image': <transformed_image>,\n    'mask': <transformed_mask>,\n    'replay': {\n        'transforms': [\n            {\n                'params': {'alpha': 0.7},\n                'applied': True\n            },\n            {\n                'params': None,\n                'applied': False\n            },\n            {\n                'transforms': [\n                    {\n                        'params': {'beta': 1.2},\n                        'applied': True\n                    }\n                ],\n                'applied': True\n            }\n        ],\n        'applied': True\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, the result includes the transformed data and a 'replay' key containing the fully serialized and annotated transformation pipeline, showing which transformations were applied and the parameters used for each."

This dictionary is typically produced by a previous run of a ReplayCompose pipeline, which records all the transformations and their parameters.\n\nInternally, replay calls the _restore_for_replay method of ReplayCompose.

The function first checks if the serialized transform is a Lambda transform by calling instantiate_lambda. If a Lambda transform is detected and found in the lambda_transforms dictionary, it is restored directly from there.\n\nIf the transform is not a Lambda, the function retrieves the class name from the \"__class_fullname__\" key and reconstructs the transform by collecting its arguments, excluding metadata keys such as \"__class_fullname__\", \"applied\", and \"params\". If the transform contains nested transforms (as in the case of composite transforms), the function recursively restores each nested transform using _restore_for_replay.\n\nAfter reconstructing the transform object, the function sets its params, enables replay mode, and marks whether it was applied during the original augmentation. This ensures that the restored transform behaves identically to the original when replayed.\n\nWithin the project, _restore_for_replay is used internally by ReplayCompose, specifically in the replay method.

It manages the logic for deciding whether the transformation should be executed, prepares the necessary parameters, and delegates the actual transformation to the appropriate method.\n\nThe method first checks if the transformation is in replay mode. If so, and if the transformation was previously applied (as indicated by the applied_in_replay attribute), it re-applies the transformation using the stored parameters by calling apply_with_params. If the transformation was not applied in the original run, it returns the input data unchanged.\n\nIf not in replay mode, the method evaluates whether the transformation should be applied based on a random probability (self.p), the always_apply flag, or if force_apply is set to True. If any of these conditions are met, it proceeds to generate the transformation parameters by calling get_params.\n\nIf the transformation requires parameters that depend on specific input targets (as indicated by the targets_as_params attribute), the method asserts that all required keys are present in the input data. It then collects the relevant target data and computes additional parameters by calling get_params_dependent_on_targets. These parameters are merged with the general parameters.\n\nFor deterministic transformations, if targets_as_params is set, a warning is issued to inform the user that replaying the transformation with different input data may lead to incorrect behavior, since the parameters depend on the targets. The parameters used for the transformation are then saved for potential replay.\n\nFinally, the method applies the transformation to the input data by calling apply_with_params with the prepared parameters and returns the result. If none of the conditions for applying the transformation are met, the input data is returned unchanged.\n\nThe __call__ method is tightly integrated with several other methods:\n- It uses get_params to obtain general transformation parameters.\n- It consults targets_as_params to determine if target-dependent parameters are needed.\n- It calls get_params_dependent_on_targets to compute parameters based on input data.\n- It delegates the actual transformation to apply_with_params, which handles the application to each target.\n\n**Note**:  \n- If replay_mode is active, the method ensures that transformations are applied consistently with previously stored parameters.\n- If targets_as_params is set, all required keys must be present in the input data, or an assertion error will be raised.\n- For deterministic transformations that depend on input targets, a warning is issued regarding potential issues in replay mode.\n- If the transformation is not applied (based on probability and flags), the input data is returned unchanged.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nSuppose the input is {'image': <image_array>, 'mask': <mask_array>}, and the transformation is applied.

Otherwise, it updates the params dictionary by calling update_params, which augments the parameters with any transformation-specific settings (such as interpolation, fill_value) and image dimensions.\n\nThe function then iterates over each key-value pair in kwargs. For each data element (e.g., image, mask), if the value is not None, it determines the correct transformation function to use by invoking _get_target_function with the current key. It also checks for any dependencies for this target by consulting target_dependence, which provides a list of other targets that the transformation may require. The function collects these dependent targets from kwargs and passes them, along with the updated params, to the transformation function.\n\nThe result for each key is stored in a new dictionary, res, which is returned at the end. If a data element is None, the corresponding result is also set to None. This approach ensures that each data element is processed with the correct transformation logic and that dependencies between targets are respected.\n\nWithin the overall transformation pipeline, apply_with_params is typically called by the __call__ method of the transformation class. The __call__ method determines whether the transformation should be applied (based on probability, replay mode, or force_apply), prepares the necessary parameters, and then delegates the actual transformation to apply_with_params.

It begins by adding the fully qualified class name under the key \"__class_fullname__\" using get_class_fullname, ensuring that the specific type of transformation can be uniquely identified during deserialization or inspection. Next, it incorporates the base initialization arguments, such as \"always_apply\" and \"p\", by updating the dictionary with the output of get_base_init_args.

Any elements beyond the fourth are preserved and appended to the transformed result, ensuring that extra attributes associated with the keypoint remain intact.\n\nThe method returns a new list where each entry is the transformed keypoint, maintaining the original structure of the input keypoints. This approach allows for consistent handling of keypoints with additional attributes, which is common in computer vision tasks involving pose estimation or object detection.\n\nWithin the broader project, apply_to_keypoints is referenced in the targets method, which maps data types (such as \"image\", \"mask\", \"bboxes\", and \"keypoints\") to their respective transformation functions. This mapping enables the transformation pipeline to automatically apply the correct function to each type of data, ensuring that keypoints are processed appropriately during augmentation.\n\nThe transformation logic for individual keypoints is defined in apply_to_keypoint, which must be implemented by subclasses. If apply_to_keypoint is not overridden, a NotImplementedError will be raised, indicating that the transformation does not support keypoints by default.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The method assumes that each keypoint is a tuple with at least four elements. The transformation is applied only to the first four elements.\n- Subclasses must implement the apply_to_keypoint method to define the actual transformation logic for a single keypoint.\n- Any additional elements in the keypoint tuple are preserved and appended to the transformed result, ensuring compatibility with extended keypoint formats.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nGiven an input keypoints list like [(10, 20, 0, 1, 0.9), (30, 40, 0, 1, 0.8)], and a transformation that shifts the x and y coordinates by +1, the output might look like [(11, 21, 0, 1, 0.9), (31, 41, 0, 1, 0.8)]. The extra attribute (e.g., 0.9, 0.8) is preserved for each keypoint."

The process begins by checking if the input list of bounding boxes is non-empty. If so, the bounding boxes are first converted from the albumentations normalized format to the \"pascal_voc\" format (absolute coordinates) using the convert_bboxes_from_albumentations function. This conversion is necessary because the imgaug library, which is used for augmentation, expects bounding boxes in absolute coordinates.\n\nNext, the bounding boxes are wrapped into an imgaug BoundingBoxesOnImage object, which associates the bounding boxes with the image dimensions (rows and cols). The deterministic_processor is then used to apply the same augmentation transformation to the bounding boxes as was applied to the image, ensuring spatial consistency.\n\nAfter augmentation, the transformed bounding boxes are extracted, and their coordinates are combined with any additional information from the original bounding boxes (such as labels or scores). The resulting list of bounding boxes is then converted back to the albumentations normalized format using convert_bboxes_to_albumentations, making them suitable for further processing or output in the albumentations pipeline.\n\nThroughout this process, the function ensures that all bounding box transformations are consistent with the image transformations, and that any extra information in the bounding box tuples is preserved. The function relies on convert_bboxes_from_albumentations and convert_bboxes_to_albumentations to handle the conversion between formats, and on the deterministic_processor to apply the actual augmentation.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The function only processes the bounding boxes if the input list is non-empty.\n- The bounding boxes are expected to be in the albumentations normalized format when passed in, and are returned in the same format after transformation.\n- The deterministic_processor must be properly configured to ensure that the same transformation is applied to both the image and the bounding boxes.\n- Any additional elements in the bounding box tuples (such as class labels) are preserved throughout the transformation process.\n- The image dimensions (rows and cols) must be correctly specified to ensure accurate coordinate transformations.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nGiven an input list of bounding boxes such as [(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 1)], after applying a horizontal flip transformation with the appropriate deterministic_processor and image dimensions rows=100, cols=200, the function might return:\n[(0.6, 0.2, 0.9, 0.5, 1)]  \nThis output reflects the transformed bounding box coordinates in the normalized albumentations format, with the label preserved."

This ensures that keypoints remain accurately aligned with the rotated image, which is critical for tasks such as object detection or pose estimation where keypoint locations must correspond to visual features.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The factor parameter must be one of {0, 1, 2, 3}; otherwise, an error will occur.\n- The additional parameters must include the image's rows (height) and cols (width) for correct computation.\n- The function expects the keypoint tuple to contain at least four elements: (x, y, angle, scale).\n- The returned keypoint maintains the same format as the input.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nGiven keypoint = (10, 20, 0.0, 1.0), factor = 1, rows = 100, cols = 200 (provided via **params), the function returns:\n(20, 189, -1.5707963267948966, 1.0)"

The method first calls the parent class's __init__ method to handle common transformation parameters such as always_apply and p.\n\nThe shift_limit, scale_limit, and rotate_limit parameters are processed using the to_tuple utility function. This ensures that each of these parameters is stored as a tuple representing a valid range, regardless of whether the user provided a scalar or a tuple.

This design improves usability and reduces the likelihood of user error.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The shift_limit, scale_limit, and rotate_limit parameters can be provided as either scalars or tuples. Scalars are automatically converted to appropriate tuples using the to_tuple function.\n- The scale_limit parameter is centered at 1.0, so a value of 0.1 results in a scaling range of (0.9, 1.1).\n- The interpolation and border_mode parameters should be set according to OpenCV conventions.\n- The value and mask_value parameters are only relevant when border_mode is set to a constant value.\n- The always_apply and p parameters control the application frequency of the transformation within a pipeline."

The border_mode determines how the borders of the image are handled during transformation, and value specifies the fill value for pixels outside the image boundary if a constant border mode is used.\n\nThe shift_scale_rotate function constructs the affine transformation matrix, applies the rotation, scaling, and translation, and then uses OpenCV's warpAffine to perform the transformation. It also ensures compatibility with images that have more than four channels by processing them in chunks if necessary.

This method is typically used as part of an image augmentation pipeline, where it standardizes the spatial size of images by cropping them to a consistent, centered region.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The input image must have dimensions at least as large as the specified crop height and width; otherwise, an error will occur.\n- The method preserves the data type and number of channels of the input image.\n- Any additional keyword arguments passed to apply are ignored in this implementation.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nIf the input image is a 4x4 array and the crop size is set to 2x2, the returned value will be the centered 2x2 region of the input, such as:\n\n[[1, 1],\n [0, 1]]"

This operation recalculates the keypoint’s (x, y) coordinates so that they are relative to the cropped region of the image. The angle and scale of the keypoint remain unchanged during this step, as cropping does not affect these attributes.\n\n2. After cropping, the function computes scaling factors for both axes: scale_x as self.width / crop_width and scale_y as self.height / crop_height. These factors represent how the cropped region will be resized to the target dimensions (self.width, self.height). The function then calls keypoint_scale, which scales the keypoint’s coordinates accordingly and updates the scale attribute of the keypoint based on the maximum scaling factor, ensuring the keypoint’s size remains consistent with the resized image.\n\nBy combining these two operations, apply_to_keypoint guarantees that keypoints are accurately transformed to match the new image geometry after both cropping and resizing, which is essential for maintaining annotation integrity during data augmentation.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The function assumes that the input keypoint is a tuple of at least four elements: (x, y, angle, scale).\n- The crop and scaling parameters must be valid and consistent with the image dimensions and the intended augmentation.\n- Only the first four elements of the keypoint tuple are processed.\n- The function does not check if the keypoint remains within the bounds of the cropped or resized image after transformation.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nGiven a keypoint (120, 80, 45, 1.0), crop_height 50, crop_width 80, h_start 0.2, w_start 0.5, rows 100, cols 200, and target dimensions self.width = 160, self.height = 100, the function might return (120.0, 60.0, 45, 2.0), representing the keypoint’s new position and scale after cropping and resizing."

The crop_keypoint_by_coords function then translates the keypoint’s x and y coordinates by subtracting the crop region’s top-left corner (x_min, y_min), effectively relocating the keypoint into the coordinate system of the cropped image. The angle and scale attributes of the keypoint remain unchanged, as cropping does not affect these properties. This ensures that after cropping, keypoints are accurately positioned relative to the new image boundaries, maintaining consistency throughout the augmentation pipeline.\n\n**Note**:  \n- Only the x and y coordinates of the keypoint are modified; angle and scale remain unchanged.\n- The method assumes that the provided crop boundaries and image dimensions are valid and consistent with the keypoint’s location.\n- No bounds checking is performed to ensure the keypoint remains within the cropped region.\n- The crop_height and crop_width parameters are calculated for interface consistency but are not used in the coordinate adjustment.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nIf the input keypoint is (120, 80, 45, 1.0), x_min is 100, x_max is 200, y_min is 50, y_max is 150, and the original image size is rows=200, cols=300, the returned value will be (20, 30, 45, 1.0), representing the new keypoint position relative to the cropped image."

By leveraging the shared optical_distortion implementation, consistency is maintained between the distorted image and mask, which is essential for supervised learning tasks in computer vision.\n\n**Note**:  \n- Always use nearest-neighbor interpolation when applying geometric transformations to masks to preserve discrete label values.\n- The mask image must be a NumPy array compatible with OpenCV operations.\n- The border_mode and mask_value parameters should be set appropriately to avoid introducing unintended label values at the image borders.\n- The function is intended for data augmentation in segmentation tasks and should be used with care to ensure label consistency.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nGiven a mask image of shape (256, 256) with integer class labels, and parameters k=0.1, dx=5, dy=-3, the function returns a NumPy array of the same shape. The mask appears distorted according to the specified parameters, but all pixel values remain valid class labels, with no interpolation artifacts."

It delegates the actual masking process to the cutout function from the functional module. The apply function receives an image, a fill_value, and a list of holes (rectangular regions to be masked), and then calls F.cutout with these arguments. The cutout function creates a copy of the input image and fills each specified rectangular region with the fill_value, returning the modified image.

The add_snow function processes the image by converting it to the HLS color space, increasing the brightness of pixels below a certain lightness threshold (determined by snow_point), and then converting the image back to RGB. The brightness_coeff parameter controls how much the selected pixels are brightened, enhancing the snow effect. The apply function serves as the core operation within the RandomSnow augmentation class, making it easy to integrate snow simulation into image augmentation pipelines for tasks such as training computer vision models.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The input image must be in RGB format and of type uint8 or float32.\n- The snow_point and brightness_coeff parameters should be chosen carefully to avoid unnatural results.\n- This function is intended for use within data augmentation pipelines and is not suitable for real-time production use without further optimization.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nGiven an RGB image of shape (256, 256, 3) and dtype float32, with snow_point=0.2, the function returns a float32 array of the same shape and range, where certain regions appear brighter and whiter, simulating the effect of snow.

It first extracts the image from the input params dictionary. A fog coefficient (fog_coef) is randomly sampled from a uniform distribution between self.fog_coef_lower and self.fog_coef_upper, which are expected to be set elsewhere in the class.\n\nThe function then determines the height and width of the image and calculates a value hw, which is proportional to the image width and the fog coefficient. This value is used to control the spread and density of the simulated fog.\n\nA haze_list is constructed to store the coordinates where fog (haze) will be applied. The algorithm initializes midx and midy to positions near the center of the image, offset by multiples of hw. It then enters a loop, which continues as long as midx or midy are greater than -hw. In each iteration, a number of random coordinates (proportional to hw and the current index) are generated within a shrinking region centered around the image's midpoint. These coordinates are appended to haze_list. After each iteration, midx and midy are decremented to move the region outward, and the index is incremented to increase the number of haze points in subsequent iterations.\n\nFinally, the function returns a dictionary containing haze_list (the list of fog coordinates) and fog_coef (the fog intensity coefficient).\n\n**Note**:  \n- The input params dictionary must contain an \"image\" key with a valid image array.\n- The function relies on the class attributes fog_coef_lower and fog_coef_upper being properly set.\n- The returned haze_list and fog_coef are intended for internal use in fog augmentation and may not be directly interpretable as visual fog without further processing.\n\n**Output Example**:  \n{\n    \"haze_list\": [(123, 45), (130, 50), (140, 60), ...],\n    \"fog_coef\": 0.42\n}"

The processed image, with the shadow effect applied, is returned in the same format as the input.\n\nWithin the project, apply serves as the method responsible for executing the shadow augmentation as part of the RandomShadow transformation.

If the image is float32, it will be temporarily converted to uint8 for processing and then restored to float32.\n- The vertices_list must contain polygons formatted as required by OpenCV's fillPoly function.\n- The function does not use any additional parameters from **params.\n- If vertices_list is empty, the image will be returned unchanged.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nGiven an RGB image of shape (256, 256, 3) and a vertices_list containing two polygons, the function returns a numpy.ndarray of the same shape and data type as the input. The regions defined by the polygons will appear darker, simulating the effect of shadows cast on those areas. For example, if the input is a float32 image with values in the range [0, 1], the output will also be a float32 image in [0, 1], with the shadowed regions clearly visible."

This standardization is important for the transform to interpret the bit depth ranges correctly and to maintain compatibility with the rest of the augmentation framework.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The num_bits parameter accepts a variety of input formats (scalar, tuple, or list), but all are internally converted to tuples for consistency.\n- If a list or tuple of length 3 is provided, each channel is treated independently; otherwise, a single range is used for all channels.\n- The always_apply and p parameters control the transform’s execution logic, as handled by the parent class.\n- The use of to_tuple ensures that all range parameters are validated and standardized, preventing errors during the augmentation process."

This value determines the color depth after posterization and must be in the range [0, 8]. The default is 1.\n· **params: Additional keyword arguments, not used directly in this function but included for compatibility with transformation pipelines.\n\n**Code Description**:  \nThis function applies a posterization transformation to the input image by calling the posterize function from the functional module. The posterize function reduces the color depth of the image by retaining only the specified number of high bits in each color channel, resulting in a stylized, poster-like effect with fewer distinct colors. The apply method serves as an interface within the Posterize transformation class, allowing the effect to be seamlessly integrated into image augmentation pipelines. The image and num_bits parameters are passed directly to the posterize function, which handles the bit masking and color reduction logic. The **params argument allows for compatibility with broader transformation frameworks, even though it is not used in this specific implementation.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The input image must be a NumPy array with dtype uint8.\n- The num_bits parameter must be in the range [0, 8].

It takes an input image and applies brightness and contrast adjustments by calling the brightness_contrast_adjust function from the functional module. The alpha parameter controls the contrast by scaling pixel values, while the beta parameter shifts pixel values to adjust brightness.

For uint8 images, a lookup table approach is used for efficiency; for other types, the image is processed in float32 precision. This abstraction allows apply to provide a consistent interface for brightness and contrast adjustment across different image types, while handling all necessary type-specific details internally.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The input image is not modified in place; a new adjusted image is returned.\n- The behavior of brightness adjustment depends on the value of self.brightness_by_max.\n- The output image's data type and value range depend on the input type and the underlying functional implementation.\n- Additional keyword arguments (**params) are accepted for compatibility but are not used in this method.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nIf img is a uint8 image of shape (256, 256, 3) and all pixel values are 100, calling apply(img, alpha=1.2, beta=30) will return a new uint8 image of the same shape, where each pixel value is adjusted for increased contrast and brightness, with values clipped to the valid range [0, 255]. For example, the output image may have pixel values of 150 if the adjustment does not exceed the maximum value."

The provided values for scale_min, scale_max, and interpolation are then stored as instance attributes for use during the transformation process.\n\n**Note**:  \n- scale_min and scale_max must both be less than 1, as values greater than or equal to 1 would not result in downscaling.\n- scale_min must not be greater than scale_max.\n- The interpolation parameter should be a valid OpenCV interpolation flag.\n- The probability p controls how often the transformation is applied when processing images."

It should be a NumPy array, typically representing an image in HWC format.\n· scale: A float value that determines the downscaling factor. For example, a value of 0.5 will reduce the image dimensions by half before upscaling back to the original size.\n· interpolation: The interpolation method used for resizing, as defined in OpenCV (e.g., cv2.INTER_NEAREST, cv2.INTER_LINEAR).\n· **params: Additional keyword arguments, not directly used in this method but included for compatibility with the transformation pipeline.\n\n**Code Description**:  \nThis method applies a two-step image transformation to simulate the effects of image downscaling and subsequent upscaling. It achieves this by invoking the downscale function from the functional module. The process first resizes the input image to a smaller size according to the provided scale factor, then restores it to its original dimensions using the specified interpolation method. This transformation is commonly used in data augmentation pipelines to introduce artifacts and loss of detail, which can help improve the robustness of computer vision models.\n\nInternally, the method delegates all processing to the F.downscale function, passing along the image, scale, and interpolation parameters. The downscale function handles all necessary data type conversions and ensures that the output image maintains the original shape and, where possible, the original data type. If the interpolation method requires it, the image may be temporarily converted to float32 for accurate resizing and then converted back to its original type.\n\n**Note**: \n- The input image must be a valid NumPy array compatible with OpenCV's resize function.\n- The scale parameter should be a positive float less than or equal to 1.0 to ensure proper downscaling.\n- The method preserves the original image shape and data type unless a conversion is required for interpolation.\n- This method is typically used within the Downscale transformation in the albumentations library.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nIf the input is a NumPy array representing an image of shape (100, 100, 3) with all pixel values set to 1 and a scale of 0.5, the output will be a NumPy array of the same shape and type, with all pixel values still equal to 1. For random images, the output will retain the original shape and type but may exhibit minor changes due to interpolation during the downscale-upscale process."
