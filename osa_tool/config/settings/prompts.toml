INPUT DATA:

1. REPOSITORY FILE TREE:

{repository_tree}

2. README CONTENT:

{readme_content}

TASK:

Based on the provided data about the files and the README content,
your task is to identify and return the paths to 4-6 key files that
contain the main business logic or project description.

Generate a JSON response following this exact structure:

{{
    "key_files": [
        "path/to/file1",
        "path/to/file2"
    ]
}}

RULES:

- The value of "key_files" must be a JSON array (list) of strings, each string representing the relative path to one important file.
- Include only the most important files that define the project’s core logic.
- Exclude files related to tests, configuration, or assets unless they are central to the business logic.
- Exclude README files.
- Return only valid JSON without additional explanations or formatting.

INPUT DATA:

1. PROJECT NAME: {project_name}

2. METADATA:

{metadata}

3. README CONTENT:

{readme_content}

4. KEY FILES CONTENTS:

{key_files_content}

TASK:

Based on the provided information about the project, generate a list of core features for the project.
Each core feature should be represented by JSON format following this exact structure:

{{
    "feature_name": "text",
    "feature_description": "text",
    "is_critical": boolean
}}

RULES:

- The output should be a JSON array.
- Each element in the array should represent one core feature.
- Use double quotes for JSON formatting.
- Be sure to generate multiple core features, each describing a different aspect of the project.
- The 'feature_name' should describe a key aspect.
- The 'feature_description' should be a detailed but short explanation of the feature.

TASK:
Generate a concise overview of the project by analyzing the provided data.
Your response should be a short paragraph that encapsulates the core use-case, value proposition.
Generate a JSON response following this exact structure:

{{

RULES:

- Focus on the project's core purpose and its value proposition without mentioning specific technical aspects.
- Avoid technical jargon, code snippets, or any implementation details.
- The overview should be no more than 60 words.

INPUT DATA:

1. PROJECT NAME: {project_name}

2. README CONTENT:

{readme_content}

3. CONTENTS OF THE EXAMPLES DIRECTORY:

{examples_files_content}

TASK:
You are generating the "Getting Started" section for the README file of the project above.
Your goal is to help a new user understand how to start using the project by analyzing the provided example files and any relevant assets (such as images or gifs) from the README.

PROCESS:

- Carefully review the example files to identify clear entrypoints, demos, or code snippets showing how to run or integrate the project.
- If any meaningful examples exist, use them to generate a concise, beginner-friendly Getting Started section with code snippets formatted in markdown code blocks.
- Additionally, review the provided README content to check for relevant images or gifs (e.g., usage demos, screenshots, or diagrams) that could enhance the Getting Started section.
- If suitable images or gifs are found, include them in the section using proper markdown syntax (`![alt text](path)`), preserving the original paths exactly as they appear in the provided README content.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Generate a JSON response following this exact structure:

{{
    "getting_started": "text or null"
}}

RULES:

- Be concise, clear, and beginner-friendly.
- Use markdown formatting, including code blocks if relevant.
- Include actual code from the example files if available.
- Include relevant images or gifs from the README if they help clarify how to start using the project.
- DO NOT make up usage instructions — rely only on the provided content.
- DO NOT invent or modify image paths — use them exactly as found in the provided README content.
- If no meaningful example files are found and no helpful images or gifs are available, return `"getting_started": null`
- Do not add a "## Getting Started" heading — only the content for that section.
- Output valid JSON, strictly following the given structure.

deduplicate_sections = """
INPUT DATA:

1. INSTALLATION SECTION CONTENT:

{installation}

2. GETTING STARTED SECTION CONTENT:

{getting_started}

TASK:
You are cleaning up and reorganizing the "Installation" and "Getting Started" sections for a project's README file.
Your goal is to eliminate duplicated or overlapping information between the two sections while preserving their logical separation:

- The "Installation" section should only contain information about how to install the project (package managers, dependencies, environment setup, etc.).
- The "Getting Started" section should only contain information about how to start using the project after it’s installed (running the program, example commands, usage demos, etc.).


PROCESS:

- Carefully review the content of both sections.
- Identify and remove any duplicated or redundant information that appears in both sections.
- If a piece of information belongs logically to the "Installation" section (like `pip install` commands or dependency instructions), move or leave it there.
- If a piece of information belongs to the "Getting Started" section (like how to run the project or a first example command), move or leave it there.
- Do not invent or modify any instructions — rely solely on the provided content.
- Preserve markdown formatting (including code blocks and image links) as they appear in the input.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return a JSON object in the following format:

{{
    "installation": "cleaned installation section text, or null if empty",
    "getting_started": "cleaned getting started section text, or null if empty"
}}

RULES:

- Remove duplicated lines or paragraphs that appear in both sections.
- Ensure each section contains only relevant, logically appropriate information.
- If a section ends up empty after deduplication, return null for that section.
- Add section header for "## Installation".
- Don't add section header for "## Getting Started".
- Output valid JSON, strictly following the given structure.

refine = """
INPUT DATA:

1. ORIGINAL README CONTENT:

{old_readme}

2. GENERATED README SECTIONS (as JSON):

{new_readme_sections}

TASK:
You are refining and restructuring the generated README by combining it with the original project's README content.

Your goal is to improve the generated README by:
- Preserving valuable information from the original README that is missing in the generated one.
- Removing redundant or outdated parts.
- Ensuring clean, consistent, and logically ordered sections.
- Keeping markdown formatting intact.
- Maintaining or expanding useful content structure when appropriate.

PROCESS:

- Use the generated README sections as the base structure.
- Carefully review both the original README content and the generated README sections.
- Integrate missing relevant content from the original README where appropriate.
- Remove duplicate, obsolete, or irrelevant content.
- Do not invent or make up new content — only use the provided data.
- Preserve markdown formatting as in the input.
- If you find meaningful sections in the original README that are not present in the generated one, you may add them as new sections in the final README **only if their content does not duplicate existing sections**.
- If new sections are added, update the Table of Contents (if present) to reflect the final list of sections using their exact titles (except for "badges" and "Overview" — these are never listed in the Table of Contents).

IMPORTANT:
- All content in the README **before the first '## '** markdown header is considered a special 'badges' section.
- The 'badges' section includes the project title, badges, and any description placed before the first '## ' header in the markdown.

FINAL OUTPUT STRUCTURE:

Return a JSON object where:
- Each key represents a section name (string).
  Example: "Overview", "Installation", "API Reference", etc.
- The "badges" section should contain all markdown content before the first '##' header.
- The value for each key should be the final cleaned content of that section (markdown text).
- The order of keys in the JSON should reflect the desired order of sections in the final README.
- If a section ends up empty, omit it from the output.

Example:

{{
    "badges": "project title, badges, description...",
    "Overview": "overview text...",
    "Installation": "installation instructions...",
    "Usage": "how to use..."
}}

RULES:

- Always output valid JSON as shown in the example.
- Do not add extra explanation or comments.
- Preserve markdown formatting.
- Remove duplicate sections or overlapping information.
- The JSON keys order determines the final README order.
- Table of Contents must reflect the final list of section keys (excluding 'badges' and 'Overview').
