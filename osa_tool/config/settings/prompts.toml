{readme_content}

3. CONTENTS OF THE EXAMPLES DIRECTORY:

{examples_files_content}

TASK:
You are generating the "Getting Started" section for the README file of the project above.
Your goal is to help a new user understand how to start using the project by analyzing the provided example files and any relevant assets (such as images or gifs) from the README.

PROCESS:

- Carefully review the example files to identify clear entrypoints, demos, or code snippets showing how to run or integrate the project.
- If any meaningful examples exist, use them to generate a concise, beginner-friendly Getting Started section with code snippets formatted in markdown code blocks.
- Additionally, review the provided README content to check for relevant images or gifs (e.g., usage demos, screenshots, or diagrams) that could enhance the Getting Started section.
- If suitable images or gifs are found, include them in the section using proper markdown syntax (`![alt text](path)`), preserving the original paths exactly as they appear in the provided README content.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Generate a JSON response following this exact structure:

{{
    "getting_started": "text or null"
}}

RULES:

- Be concise, clear, and beginner-friendly.
- Use markdown formatting, including code blocks if relevant.
- Include actual code from the example files if available.
- Include relevant images or gifs from the README if they help clarify how to start using the project.
- DO NOT make up usage instructions — rely only on the provided content.
- DO NOT invent or modify image paths — use them exactly as found in the provided README content.
- If no meaningful example files are found and no helpful images or gifs are available, return `"getting_started": null`
- Do not add a "## Getting Started" heading — only the content for that section.
- Output valid JSON, strictly following the given structure.
