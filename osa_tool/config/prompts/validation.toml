TASK:
Analyze the attached Python source code file and extract the following information:

1. For each class defined in the file:
   - Class name
   - Its docstring (if present; otherwise an empty string "")
   - A brief description of what the class does (inferred from code if no docstring)

extract_document_sections = """
INPUT DATA:
{doc_content}

TASK:
Analyze the provided Russian-language documentation text from a scientific or technical project and extract the following sections as plain text:

1. **Abstract** — look for a section titled exactly or similarly to "Реферат". Do NOT use "Введение" (Introduction) as a substitute.
2. **Experiments / Implementation** — look for sections titled "Программная реализация", "Реализация", "Алгоритмы", "Архитектура", "Пример использования", or similar that describe the actual code, system design, or experimental setup.
3. **Results** — look for a section titled "Результаты". Do NOT include "Выводы" (Conclusions) or "Заключение" unless they explicitly contain numerical or empirical results.

Return the extracted content in a JSON object with keys: "abstract", "experiments", and "results".

RULES:
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object—no extra text, markdown, or commentary.
- Preserve the original Russian text exactly as it appears, including line breaks and special characters.
- If a section appears multiple times, concatenate all relevant parts in order of appearance.
- If a section is not found, return an empty string ("").
- Do NOT translate, paraphrase, summarize, or modify the text.
- Do NOT include section headings unless they are part of the original paragraph (e.g., if the text starts with "Результаты: ...", keep it).

validate_doc_against_repo = """
INPUT DATA:
{doc_info}

{code_files_info}

TASK:
Compare the Russian-language documentation (which describes experiments and results) with the actual implementation in the repository code.

Evaluate the following:
- Does the code implement the methods, algorithms, system architecture, or experimental procedures described in the documentation’s "experiments" or "implementation" section?
- Are the datasets, input formats, evaluation metrics, and key parameters consistent between the documentation and the code?
- Can the reported results (e.g., performance numbers, outputs, behaviors) be reproduced using the provided code?

Based on this comparison:
1. Set "correspondence" to `true` if the code substantially implements what the documentation claims; otherwise `false`.
2. Assign a "percentage" score (0.0–100.0) reflecting the degree of alignment (100.0 = full reproducibility and coverage).
3. Write a brief "conclusion" in English explaining the score, citing specific matches or gaps (e.g., missing evaluation script, undocumented preprocessing step).

RULES:
- The documentation is in Russian—analyze its technical meaning directly; do NOT translate it unless necessary for reasoning.
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object—no extra text, markdown, or commentary.
- Use English for the "conclusion" field to ensure consistency in downstream processing.
- If critical components (e.g., training loop, dataset loader, metric calculation) are absent from the code, assign a low percentage.
- Base your judgment exclusively on the provided inputs.

extract_paper_section = """
INPUT DATA:

TASK:
Analyze the attached scientific paper and extract the following sections as plain text:

1. The **Abstract** section (usually titled "Abstract").
2. The section describing the **experiments** (may be titled "Experiments", "Experimental Setup", "Methodology", "Materials and Methods", or similar—use your best judgment to identify where the experimental procedures are described).
3. The **Results** section (typically titled "Results", "Findings", or similar—do not include the "Discussion" or "Conclusion" unless they are merged with Results).

Return the extracted text for each section in a JSON object with the keys: "abstract", "experiments", and "results".

RULES:
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object—no additional text, explanations, or formatting.
- For each section:
  - If found, include the full text exactly as it appears (preserving line breaks, equations, BibTeX, DOIs, etc.).
  - If multiple relevant sections exist (e.g., multiple experiment subsections), concatenate them into a single string in logical order.
  - If no such section exists, return an empty string ("").
- Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or add content.
- Do NOT include section titles unless they appear in the original text.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

validate_paper_against_repo = """
INPUT DATA:
{paper_info}

{code_files_info}

TASK:
Compare the scientific paper's described experiments and results with the actual implementation and experimental code in the repository.

Specifically:
- Does the code implement the methods, models, or algorithms described in the paper's experiments section?
- Are the datasets, evaluation metrics, and experimental procedures consistent with those reported?
- Are the results (e.g., numerical outcomes, figures, tables) reproducible from the provided code?

Based on this comparison:
1. Determine if there is substantial compliance between the paper and the code (`true` for compliant, `false` otherwise).
2. Assign a percentage score (0.0 to 100.0) reflecting how well the repository code aligns with the paper’s experimental claims.
3. Provide a concise justification for your assessment.

RULES:
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object—no additional text, markdown, or explanations.
- The percentage must be a float between 0.0 and 100.0.
- If key experimental details are missing from the code (e.g., no training script, no evaluation), reflect this in a low score.
- Base your judgment solely on the provided paper excerpts and code analysis.

INPUT DATA:
{paper_content}

TASK:
1. Identify the section(s) of the paper describing experiments (titles may include "Experiments", "Experimental Setup", "Methodology", "Materials and Methods", or similar), but don't rely solely on titles.
2. From that text, list each explicitly described experiment in the order presented, using a direct description from the text. An experiment is a procedure carried out to support or refute a hypothesis, or determine the efficacy or likelihood of something previously untried.
3. Experiment descriptions should be extracted with the exact wording as given in the original paper.
4. Experiments have to be described clearly, so it would be possible to tell wheather or not this experiment can be reproduced with code.
5. Replace ONLY non-askii characters with its askii variant.

RULES:
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text, explanations, or formatting.
- If no experiment section exists, return {{"experiment_list": []}}.
- Do not paraphrase, infer, or add any content not present in the input.
- Do NOT include section titles unless they appear in the original text.

TASK:
For provided experiment description assess of how much of the proposed experiment is actually present in the code base and exactly where in the code such experiment is implemented and return a valid JSON object with following structure
{{
  "assessment": "assessment of how much of the proposed experiment is actually present in the code base with the name of specific code module or function"
  "correlation_percent": float in range from 0.0 to 1.0 with your estimation of how much the code correlates with the provided experiment description.

RULES:
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text, explanations, or formatting.
- For "assessment", provide a brief assessment of how much of that specific experiment is implemented in the code base. Keep it in 1-2 sentences.
- "correlation_percent": Float between 0.0 and 1.0 representing your estimate of implementation completeness (0=not implemented, 0.5=partially implemented, 1=fully implemented)
- Assessments should focus on: whether the code implements the methods/models described, uses correct datasets/evaluation metrics, and allows reproduction of the experiment.
- Consider partial implementations (e.g., model implemented but training loop missing = ~0.3-0.4). If something is missing, explain why it is crucial to have it.
- Base assessments solely on comparing the experiment description with the provided code_files_info.
